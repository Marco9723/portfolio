  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
    I'm a passionate and highly motivated engineer with a focus on audio technologies, machine learning and AI. 
    My background combines classical signal processing and audio engineering with modern deep learning techniques. 
    These interests of mine are born from a strong passion for music and playing. 
    I enjoy solving real-world challenges through research and innovation. 
    In addition, I have a strong background in mathematics and physics gained during my undergraduate studies.
    Currently seeking opportunities that involve research and development in AI-driven music technologies 
    or that align with my academic background and personal interests in audio, multimedia and engineering.
